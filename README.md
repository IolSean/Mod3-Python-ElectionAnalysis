# Mod3-Python-ElectionAnalysis
**Project Overview**
I have been licensed *(i haven't really been licened)* by the Colorado Board of Elections (CBE) to complete an audit of a recent, local congressional seat election.
This entailed,
  1. Calculating the total vote count.
  2. Determining the candidates who recieved votes.
  3. Calcuating the count each candidate votes.
  4. Calcuating the percentage of each candidate's votes of total.
  5. Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote.
 
 **Challenge Overview**
 This also entailed,
  1. Listing the counties comprising the congressional district.
  2. Calcualting the county vote totals
  3. Determining the country with the highest turnout by count and precentage
  4. Determining the turnout by count and percentage of the other countires

**Resources**
Python 3.7.6, VS Code 1.45.1

**Summary**
  1. There were 369,711 votes cast
  2. 'Charles Casper Stockham', 'Diana DeGette', and 'Raymon Anthony Doane' all recieved votes
  3. The vote count & percentage for each canidate follows,
    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
  4. The winner of the election with 73.8% of the vote is Diana De Gette 

**Challenge Summary**
  1. At least parts of Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe counties voted in the congressional election
  2. The county voting totals are as folows
    - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
    - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
    - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
  3. The country with the highest count of voters is Denver County with 82.8% of total votes cast and 306,055 votes total.
      - note 1: turnout is different than count of voters. Turnout would be the count of votes cast in a county for this congressional district divided by the total voting age population within a county boundary of the given congressional district
      - note 2: a congressional district would not necessarily encompass or be encompassed by every or any country that it is a part of, so county population totals would not be helpful in finding the actual turnout
      - note 3: congressional districts are redrawn following every census and the current borders are almost 10 years old.
